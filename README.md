## Testing (RSpec)
* Start by writing tests to make sure players win when they should, e.g. when the board reads X X X across the top row, your `#game-over` method (or its equivalent) should trigger.

* Test each of your critical methods to make sure they function properly and handle edge cases.

* Try using mocks/doubles to isolate methods and make sure that they're sending back the right outputs.

## Development Languages
* Ruby v2.3

## TODO
1. ~~Have random player start game~~
